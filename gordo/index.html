            <!--Image of Gordo above-->
            <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. <em>Eight</em>
                monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.</p>
            <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on <strong>December 13, 1958</strong> when he took off from
                <strong>Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space</strong>. Even though he was weightless for
                over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists
                monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the
                entry into space
                was a modest slowing of his pulse.
            </p>
            <h3>The Mission</h3>
            <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the <strong>Atlantic Missile Range at Cape
                    Canaveral</strong>, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - <em>over 1,500
                    miles</em>
                - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the <strong>South
                    Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote><q>We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to
                    think
                    that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a
                    man
                    up to do a monkey's work.</q>

            <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Jupiter IRBM</strong> (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the
                US Army as a
                long-range successor to its <em>PGM-11 Redstone</em> missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed
                by the USAF
                for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles
                with
                some mobility.</p>
            <h3>The Journey</h3>
            <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit
                was
                fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic
                suborbital
                journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.</p>

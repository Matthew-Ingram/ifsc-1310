    <h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview</h2>
    <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon
      made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the
      International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments.</p>
    <p>It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.
      Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans.</p>
    <p>Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew.
      Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</p>

        <li>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the
          International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant
          amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo
          in its trunk.</li>
        <li>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient
          packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as
          freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</li>

        <li>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA - Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with
          NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.</li>
        <li>CREW UPGRADES - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, with seating for
          seven, life-support systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.</li>
        <li>FIRST LAUNCH - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned test flight is expected
          to take place as early as 2018.</li>

        <li>LONGEVITY - It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space and back to Earth on
          missions ranging from one week to two years.</li>
        <li>CAPABILITIES - DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity
          experiments, radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests.</li>

      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>From what I can tell, it seems that progressive enhancement is the idea of starting with a solid structure for
        a project, and then building out the stylistic elements and additional functionality from there. In progressive
        enhancement, it is emphasized to get a sturdy foundation of content in a project, this way even those who may
        not have the most advanced of browsers can still enjoy as positive of an experience as possible while trying to
        browse the content of a site or other project.</p>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because accessibility is more of an integral
        quality for a site than ever. With the great variation of browsers and devices that may be used for accessing
        the internet, it is of great importance to be able to serve as many users as possible without them experiencing
        the kinds of significant inconveniences that may end up turning them away.</p>
      <p>After my reading of the article about progressive enhancement, I finally realized that we have been more or
        less learning about this concept for this entire semester. We had started with multiple weeks of learning HTML,
        which is the main content and structural layer of websites, and from then on, we have been mostly learning about
        how to build upon that foundational content layer with CSS and other such resources.</p>
      <p>Another article that I found while looking at progressive enhancement is <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a"
          title="Additional resource on progressive enhancement">What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it
          matters</a>. This resource mainly covers the same information as our assigned reading, but it does take some
        different approaches to explaining progressive enhancement and the reasons for why it is important.</p>

      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>I feel that this Web Technologies course has been quite challenging for me, and I have struggled at various
        points throughout this semester on various projects, however, I feel that I have also gotten quite a lot out of
        this course as well. I have never attended a traditional programming course ever before, and so this course has
        been quite a unique learning experience for me. I enjoyed learning about not only the programming side of this
        course, but also the side more focused on other principles and ideas related to the computer/programming
        industry, such as how to gather information from clients on what they are looking for in a website, or how to
        utilize progressive enhancement in our programming projects.</p>
      <p>In order to collect feedback on the initial version of my SpaceX Dragon project, I asked my father to take a
        look at the website, and after a few minutes of his looking around at the various pages and content on the
        website, he told me that there wasn't really anything that he could think of for me to change. Because I still
        wished to get some
        feedback on the project, and because I had been curious about possibly making a significant change to the site's
        color scheme, I asked him about whether or not I should change the backgrounds of the website from a white/light
        theme to a black/dark theme, and after a little discussion he said that it might be a good idea to make the
        change. After making the transition from white to black backgrounds, I realized that the pure black coloration
        clashed heavily with the rest of my site's blueish color scheme, and so I changed the black background into a
        dark navy color, which I think blends together a little better with the rest of the site.</p>
      <p>I think that the part of the site building process that I enjoyed the most was when I was composing the CSS
        that would be used to enhance my HTML. I think that the highly organized and easily accessible structure of the
        CSS sort of clicked with me; for the most part, I felt like I had a fairly easy time with targeting the various
        elements within the HTML of my project, and I felt mostly comfortable with the CSS techniques used within the
        project.</p>
      <p>If I were to start the entire website project over again, I would most likely try to procrastinate less with my
        project. During the process of constructing the initial version of the final website and even when I began work
        on the finalized version of the website, I put off working on the project quite a lot, and this ended up making
        the times where I did work on the website more stressful, as when I was trying to make up for lost time, I would
        also usually end up making simple mistakes in my programming along the way. By procrastinating less, I would
        probably have been able to remain much more calm and focused on getting done with the tasks at hand, rather than
        worrying myself and scrambling to complete some of the parts of the project.</p>
      <p>Overall, I believe that my experience with this course has been quite informative and engaging, and I also
        think that it has been a valuable introduction to writing code and organizing programming projects. I
        additionally feel that the course has further increased my interest in pursuing some form of programming as a
        career in the future.</p>

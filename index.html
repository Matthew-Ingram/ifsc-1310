      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>From what I can tell, it seems that progressive enhancement is the idea of starting with a solid structure for
        a project, and then building out the stylistic elements and additional functionality from there. In progressive
        enhancement, it is emphasized to get a sturdy foundation of content in a project, this way even those who may
        not have the most advanced of browsers can still enjoy as positive of an experience as possible while trying to
        browse the content of a site or other project.</p>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because accessibility is more of an integral
        quality for a site than ever. With the great variation of browsers and devices that may be used for accessing
        the internet, it is of great importance to be able to serve as many users as possible without them experiencing
        the kinds of significant inconveniences that may end up turning them away.</p>
      <p>After my reading of the article about progressive enhancement, I finally realized that we have been more or
        less learning about this concept for this entire semester. We had started with multiple weeks of learning HTML,
        which is the main content and structural layer of websites, and from then on, we have been mostly learning about
        how to build upon that foundational content layer with CSS and other such resources.</p>
      <p>Another article that I found while looking at progressive enhancement is <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a"
          title="Additional resource on progressive enhancement">What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it
          matters</a>. This resource mainly covers the same information as our assigned reading, but it does take some
        different approaches to explaining progressive enhancement and the reasons for why it is important.</p>
